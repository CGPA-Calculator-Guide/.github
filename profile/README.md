## How is CGPA Calculated?

The CGPA is calculated by averaging the grade points obtained in all subjects, excluding additional subjects where applicable. Each grade point corresponds to the marks achieved in a subject, and the cumulative average gives a precise indication of overall academic performance.

## Formula for CGPA Calculation

The basic formula to calculate CGPA is:

```
CGPA = (Sum of Grade Points in All Subjects) / (Number of Subjects)
```

For example, if a student has grade points of 8, 9, 7, and 10 in four subjects, their CGPA would be:

```
CGPA = (8 + 9 + 7 + 10) / 4 = 8.5
```
